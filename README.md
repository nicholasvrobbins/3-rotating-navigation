Summary: Following along with Brad and Florin doing 50 JavaScript projects to get better at JavaScript. Today we did a menu click that rotates the entire page when clicked. Pretty simple JavaScript but wasn't able to have it click to return the page back to previous version, so will work on that. The past few projects really show how much of this is CSS and simply using JavaScript click mechanics to add/remove a CSS class that shifts the page. Pretty simple projects, but still fun to try and build some new things.
